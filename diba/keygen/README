README

  These are the key generation routines for the DIBA project.
  
  They can be used as standalone tools for:
  
        key generation / encryption / decryption.

FILES

    dibakeygen     --      Key generator.
    dibakeyinfo    --      Key report tool. Mostly used for check / list keys. 
    dibakeyedit    --      Key editing tool. Minimal implementation. 
    
 See Makefile for typical usage examples. Follow the tests make path to see
frequent useage. The programs will print basic usage information on request.

BUILD

 All the files are built on Windows using MSYS and MinGW. The files should
build on linux and variants with little modification.
 
PREP

 NOTE: now we are using libraries from the officaldistros. Disregard prep below.
 
 Build the glibcrypt library first. (if applicable) 
This project will look for the built libs and includes in the .lib subdir 
under the original build directories.
This allows installation-less build. (for test and experimentation)
Then build the tools subdirectory. 

Make sure you update references when building new library versions.

TESTING

 'make tests' will build the needed files and execute a diff on generated 
outputs. It is comparing them with expected output of the original files. 
Test passes if the diffs are silent.

FEEDBACK

 This code is being developed for a larger project. However, taming the library
and creating a keygen layer  is a common task, so I shared it ...
