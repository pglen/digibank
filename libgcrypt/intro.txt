Libgcrypt is a general purpose cryptographic library originally based on code from GnuPG. It provides functions for all cryptograhic building blocks: symmetric cipher algorithms (AES, Arcfour, Blowfish, Camellia, CAST5, ChaCha20 DES, GOST28147, Salsa20, SEED, Serpent, Twofish) and modes (ECB,CFB,CBC,OFB,CTR,CCM,GCM,OCB,POLY1305,AESWRAP), hash algorithms (MD2, MD4, MD5, GOST R 34.11, RIPE-MD160, SHA-1, SHA2-224, SHA2-256, SHA2-384, SHA2-512, SHA3-224, SHA3-256, SHA3-384, SHA3-512, SHAKE-128, SHAKE-256, TIGER-192, Whirlpool), MACs (HMAC for all hash algorithms, CMAC for all cipher algorithms, GMAC-AES, GMAC-CAMELLIA, GMAC-TWOFISH, GMAC-SERPENT, GMAC-SEED, Poly1305, Poly1305-AES, Poly1305-CAMELLIA, Poly1305-TWOFISH, Poly1305-SERPENT, Poly1305-SEED), public key algorithms (RSA, Elgamal, DSA, ECDSA, EdDSA, ECDH), large integer functions, random numbers and a lot of supporting functions.

Libgcrypt works on most POSIX systems and many pre-POSIX systems. It can also be built using a cross-compiler system for Microsoft Windows.
