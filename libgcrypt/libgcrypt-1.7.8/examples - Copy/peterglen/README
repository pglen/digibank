  These are encryption samples for the gcrypt library. They can be used
as a standalone project for key generation / encryption / decryption.

FILES

    keygen          --      Key generator.
    asencrypt       --      Asymmetric encryption with public key.
    asdecrypt       --      Asymmetric decryption with private key.

BUILD

 All the files are built on windows using MSYS and MinGW. The files should
build on linux and variants with little modification.
 
PREP

 Build the glibcrypt library first. This project will look for the built
libs and includes in the .lib subdir under the original build directories.
This allows installation-less build. (for test and experiment)

NOTABLES

  I made a small malloc subsystem. It can be used to detect leaks very easily.
Use zalloc() like you would use malloc(). If you make an alloc mistake, this 
malloc gently prints a string like:

    zmalloc: Memory leak on gcry.c at line 711 (0x010A1178)    
    
  Also created a base64 encode / decode subsystem. See headers and source 
for more info.

FEDDBACK

This code was developed for a larger project. However, taming the librery is
a common task, so I shared it ...
