Oh God
Please Shine Your Light Tonight
For The World Needs Your Love
More Then Ever Now
 
Right NOW  , Some How
I Know , That There’ll Come a Day
One Day , Some Day
When The World Will Know PEACE
 
When There Will Be PEACE
There Will Be PEACE
 
 
We’re In A Time Of War
When All I Want Is Peace.
In This World Of Evolution
Breeds Money And Greed
 
Power And Fame
It’s All The Same
We Play By My Rules
Or We Don’t Play The Game
 
It’s A Holy War
Built On Wrong And Right
So Much Confusion
Why Do We All Fight ?
 
 
I Say Now When ,
Will We Come Together ?
And When ,
Will We Finally See ?
 
When ,
Will We Love One Another ?
And When ,
Will This Fighting End ?
 
 
Oh God
Please Shine Your Light Tonight
For The World Needs Your Love
More Then Ever
