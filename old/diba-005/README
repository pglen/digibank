Digital Bank

 Crypto currency. 
 
NOTE

  Only items in the 'transport' directory are funtional. The rest is under 
development. See individual subdirs for more README-s.
 
BUILD

 All the files are built on Windows using MSYS and MinGW. The files should
build on linux and variants with little modification.
 
PREP

 Build the glibcrypt library first. This project will look for the built
libs and includes in the .lib subdir under the original build directories.
This allows installation-less build. (for test and experimentation)

Make sure you update references when building new library versions.

STRUCTURE

  The directories are arranged as follows
  
   ./diba                                 - study cases for now
   ./diba/tools                           - dependency
   ./diba/transport                       - asymmetric encryption
   ./diba/bluepoint                       - dependency
   ../libgcrypt/libgcrypt-1.7.8           - dependency
   ../libgcrypt/libgpg-error-1.27         - dependency
 
  
Files:

diba.h              Header for the central items        
dibadec.c           Decode stuff
dibagen.c           Generate token
dibapow.c           Proof of work feasability
digibank.c          Feasability study for digibank
