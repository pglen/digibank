 Aliens visit Earth, fly around a bit, then decide to talk to the natives.

Aliens: "How come you have so much trash and toxic waste everywhere?"
Humans: "Because we don't have enough money to build proper facilities for 
refuse." 

Aliens: "What about all the hungry and homeless?"
Humans: "That's because we don't have enough money for food and shelter for 
everyone." 

Aliens: "OK... but what about all the wars?"
Humans: "We fight wars because we are always short on money and try to take 
it from our neighbors." 

Aliens: "Wow... You see, we've been all around this galaxy, explored 
thousands of planets, but nowhere had we encountered this, apparently very 
very precious resource called "money". Please tell us where in the galaxy 
we can find it, so we can go there, collect it and bring it to you so that 
you have enough." 
Humans: "We print it ourselves."

Aliens: "Ahem... did you say "yourselves?"...
.... and that is how planet Earth was removed from the list of intelligent 
worlds.
