 Digital Bank  (DIBA)

 Crypto currency. Unique as in all the currency is allocated at inception.
Development is done on a 2048 bit  engine, the real thing will be 4096 bit.
This is more numbers than atoms in the universe.
 
NOTE

  Items in the 'tools' directory are funtional. (jul 2017)
  Items in the 'bluepoint' directory are funtional. (aug 2017)
  Items in the 'transport' directory are funtional. (sep 2017)
  Items in the 'gui' directory are partially funtional. (oct 2017)
  Items in the 'blockchain' directory are partially funtional. (oct 2017)
  
The rest is under development. See individual subdirs for more README-s.
 
BUILD

 All the files are built on Windows using MSYS and MinGW. The files should
build on linux and variants with little modification. See INSTALL for more 
infomation.
 
PREP

 Build the glibcrypt library first. This project will look for the built
libs and includes in the .lib subdir under the original build directories.
This allows installation-less build. (for test and experimentation)

Make sure you update references when building new library versions.

STRUCTURE

  The directories are arranged as follows: (partial list)
  
   ./diba-NNN/study                         - study cases for now
   ./diba-NNN/tools                         - dependency
   ./diba-NNN/transport                     - asymmetric encryption
   ./diba-NNN/bluepoint                     - encryption code, dependency
   ./diba-NNN/blockchain                    - blockchain code (partial)
   ./diba-NNN/gui                           - pygtk user interface (partial)
   ./diba-NNN/common                        - common code for diba 
   ../libgcrypt/libgcrypt-1.7.8             - dependency
   ../libgcrypt/libgpg-error-1.27           - dependency
  
    NNN stands for local version, 006 in 2017 oct
